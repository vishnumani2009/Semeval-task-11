A signal can be an individual user event, such as a \u201clike\u201d on Wimbledon\u2019s Facebook page, or a user activity, such as a check-in at a tennis club. traceableInterests is a ranked list of interests for the user where each interest, or node, is assigned a \u201cscore\u201d by GraphDive\u2019s algorithms reflecting its importance or relevance to the user. Each interest has a \u201cnodeName\u201d and corresponding \u201cnodeId\u201d and references items from the sourceContentDigests list that contributed to that particular node or interest\u2019s score. - Know Your Customers.

Signals are individual user events, such as a \u201clike\u201d, or a user activity such as a check-in. For example, a \u201clike\u201d of Kobe Bryant\u2019s Facebook page and a \u201cLet\u2019s go LAKERS!\u201d post are both signals that support a user\u2019s interest in basketball. taggedTraceableScoredActions provides a list of recommended products/content from the given CATALOGNAME and the user interest that they fit under. The products/content are listed under the \"scoredActions\" field and ranked by GraphDive\u2019s algorithms to reflect their relevance to the user. The user interest that the recommended products/content fit under is identified by a \u201cnodeName\u201d and corresponding \u201cnodeId\u201d. Each interest references items from the sourceContentDigests list that contributed to that particular interest\u2019s score. For example, in the output below, the most important signals supporting \u201cWilson Wave Indoor/Outdoor Intermediate Basketball\u201d as a recommended product and the corresponding user interest in basketball are indicated by the contentDigestIndices. The contentDigestIndices contain indices and scores that refer to the sourceContentDigests. In this case, the indices (0, 1 and 2) correspond to the user\u2019s \u201clike\u201d of \"Basketball\", \"Kobe Bryant\", and a user post of \"Let's go LAKERS!\", respectively. The \u201cscore\u201d field under contentDigestIndices is the strength of the contribution to the interest of Basketball of the individual signal (sourceContentDigests) referenced. The higher the score, the stronger the contribution of that index to the interest. - Know Your Customers.

It has two components: sourceContentDigests and categoryTraceableProfiles. GraphDive\u2019s algorithms single out the most important signals from all the noisy signals in a user\u2019s social profile and associated data to generate a ranked set of categorized interests for that user. sourceContentDigests is where you can find the Facebook signals that support a given user interest as ranked by GraphDive\u2019s algorithms. A signal can be an individual user event, such as a \u201clike\u201d on Wimbledon\u2019s Facebook page, or a user activity, such as a check-in at a tennis club. categorizedTraceableProfiles is a sorted list of interest categories (e.g., Sports or Arts) where the categories (each under \u201ccategoryName\u201d) are ranked by GraphDive\u2019s algorithms to reflect their relative importance to the user. Each category is then supported by individual user interests or nodes appearing under the traceableInterests list. Each such interest has a \u201cnodeName\u201d and corresponding \u201cnodeId\u201d and references items from the sourceContentDigests list that contributed to that particular node or interest\u2019s score. - Know Your Customers.
